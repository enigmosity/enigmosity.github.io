This is my personal site, made with very basic HTML and CSS, hosted on GitHub pages. 

## Why a static site?

I figure I don't really need much here. It's just a personal website. There's no need to show off, my skills and experience don't stem from any front-end experience or prowess. If you want to know more about me and my skills, check out my LinkedIn or reach out to me directly.

## Why GitHub pages?

Ease of set up and minimal cost. I was initially intending to set up the static site via an AWS S3 bucket and hope to remain within the free tier. Whilst playing around with options, I realised that GitHub Pages would give me everything I need without the pain of setting anything up through AWS. It was simple, straightforward, and I already had a repo created.
